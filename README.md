## Overview
Kate would like to pursue a bike sharing start up business in Des Moines. Our team is assembled to use data from New York Citi Bike data and prove its success. Kate would like us to use tableau in order to create a good visualization and analysis. Kate's potential investors will be inquiring about this data analysis to understand if it will be viable.

## Results
### Checkout Times for Users

Most trip duration times are around 10 minutes. There is a gradual increase from 0-10 minutes and gradual decrease from 10-40 minutes. This may be due to minimal stops or bike trails nearby, as frequent stops will increase trip duration.

### Checkout Times by Gender

![Checkout Times by Gender(2)](https://github.com/Kisdigimonde/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout_Times_by_Gender(2).png)

Most riders are male and most trip duration times are around 10 minutes. And, females that are about 3x less than male riders have a similar ride time, but seem to end their ride earlier than males - with rides a little under 10 minutes and their gradual decrease after the peak being lesser than males. And, the amount of unknown riders are significantly lower than male and female riders, yet have the longest trip duration average - their trips are around 10-30 minutes.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
![Trips by Weekday for Each Hour](https://github.com/Kisdigimonde/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips_by_Weekday_for_Each_Hour.png)

Trip start times on weekdays are most usually before or after the standard 9AM - 5PM business work hours. Most trips start between 6-9AM and 4-8PM. Riders may be utilizing the bikes for excerise or joy before or after work, or riding to and from work. Correspondingly, the weekends have a continuous but later start time because the 9-5 workers do not work on the weekend and will sleep in longer.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](https://github.com/Kisdigimonde/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips_by_Gender_(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)

Trip start times by gender and weekday break down how many males. vs females vs unknown start their trips. Again, males are the most frequent riders and on weekdays usually ride before or after the 9-5 work time, with a tad bit more start times during the week days than females. And, females similarily start most rides before or after the 9-5 work schedule. And, both female and male ride continuously during weekends with later starts. Lastly, unknown riders are most prevalent on weekends throughout the day.

### Top Starting Locations
![Top Starting Locations](https://github.com/Kisdigimonde/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Top_Staring_Locations.png)

Top starting locations are in a cluster with a latitude of about 40 and a longitude of about -74. This may be due to a larger range of bikes in these locations, larger population, more work places, a busier area, or a trail nearby.

### Subscribers vs Customers
![Subscribers vs Customers](https://github.com/Kisdigimonde/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Subs_vs_Cust.png)
Most riders are subscribers and this may because riders feel obligated to ride as they pay an annual fee. Whereas short-term cutomers may take a joy ride once in a while with no commitment.

## Sumamry
Kate had asked the team to use tableau to create good visualizations for their investors to check out. In Des Moines, Kate is wanting to create a bike sharing business similar to the New York Citi Bike that we are using data from. Overall, we can see that most riders are subscribers, male, and work a 9-5 schedule. Kate may be able to create a catered business plan to the needs of Des Moines that will most likely be similar to Citi Bike.

### Extra Visualization 
- A weekly chart for an entire year. This will help show if colder or hotter months, or long weekends or holidays will make a difference.
- A predicted map of where riders would most likely want to start rides. And if more, less, or the same amount of bikes should be at different locations.
